TURBO DEBUGGER 1.0: COMMON QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
------------------------------------------------

  Q. How does TD handle screen output for graphics- and text-based
     programs?

  A. Turbo debugger has a number of strategies that it can use to
     control how and when the screen gets refreshed. If you are
     debugging a program that uses a graphics display mode or if
     you want to use Borland pop-up utilities such as SideKick
     and SideKick Plus while inside Turbo Debugger, you should
     review the following hints.

     The default screen-updating mode is "Flip," meaning that
     Turbo Debugger uses an alternate video display page on
     adapters that support multiple display pages. This results
     in fast screen-swapping between Turbo Debugger and your
     program, but it also can interfere with the operation of
     pop-up utilities and graphics programs.

     Pop-up utilities may not appear on the screen, even though
     they are active and processing your keystrokes. You must
     select "Swap" mode for display-updating in order for pop-ups
     to work properly. Use Turbo Debugger's -ds command-line
     option to do this, or use the TDINST utility to permanently
     set this mode. "Swap" mode makes screen updating slower, but
     it makes sure that Turbo Debugger's screen does not
     interfere with either your program's or any pop-up's
     display.

     You may also need to use "Swap" when you use the OS Shell
     command or run an editor from within TD. Most programs
     expect to run on video page 0, and do not check to see what
     the current video page is. TD's OS Shell and any editors
     that TD runs in "Flip" mode do not run from video page 0,
     and the programs may appear to hang, even though you will be
     able to type in keystrokes normally. If this happens, use
     the -ds command-line option when you run TD or reinstall TD
     to use "Swap" instead of "Flip."

     If you are debugging a graphics mode application, you must
     specify the -ds command-line option ("Swap" contents) and
     youÿmay want to use Turbo Debugger's -vg command-line
     option (Graphics Save). This causes additional memory to be
     set aside for saving the entire graphics image that your
     program produces. If you don't use this option, a "red
     cloud" may appear on your program's screen. These options
     can also be set permanently by using the TDINST program.
     The Graphics Save option takes an additional 8K of memory
     and slows screen-swapping.

     If you are running a graphics progrÿm that changes the EGA
     palette, make sure that you use the -vp command line option
     to save the palette.

  Q. Can Turbo Debugger execute other programs while you are
     still using the debugger?

  A. The OS Shell and Edit commands in the Module and File
     windows can swap the program you are debugging to disk in
     order to make room to run DOS or your editor. The default
     amount of memory to swap is 128K. You can use TDINST to set a
     different amount if that's not enough memory to run your
     editor or other programs. Setting the swap size to 0K tells
     Turbo Debugger to swap the entire user program to disk
     before running the DOS command processor.

     Only your program gets swapped to disk, Turbo Debugger
     remains in memory.

  Q. How can I break out of a program even though interrupts are
     disabled?

  A. If you have an 80386-chip-based computer and are using
     TD386, option -B allows break even when interrupts are
     disabled. For example, this option enables a break from

       CLI
       JMP $

  Q. Why can't I hit Ctrl-Break to get out of a program
     running on a remote machine?

  A. The program running in the remote machine has taken control
     of Interrupt 1B (Ctrl-Break), TDREMOTE does not take back
     control of Interrupt 1B until you stop execution of the
     running program on the debugger side by completing the
     program or hitting Ctrl-F2 (Program Reset).


  Q. What are some of the syntactic and parsing differences
     between Turbo Debugger's built-in assembler and the
     standalone Turbo Assembler?

  A. The following short example program is discussed in the
     text that follows it:

              .model small
              .data

       abc    struc
       mem1   dd      ?
       mem2   db      ?
       mem3   db      "   "
       abc    ends

              align   16
       a      abc     <1,2,"xyz">

       msg1   db      "testing 1 2 3", 0
       msg2   db      "hello world", 0
       nmptr  dw      msg1
       fmptr  dd      msg1,msg2
       nfmptr dw      fmptr
       xx     dw      seg a

              .code

              push   cs
              pop    ds
              mov    bx,offset a
              mov    bx,nmptr
              les    si,fmptr
              mov    ah,4ch
              int    21h
              end

     The assembler expression parser does not accept all legal
     TASM instruction operands. This allows TD's assembler
     expressions to be more general and allow multiple levels of
     memory-referencing, more like that used in C and Pascal.
     However, there are a few constructs that you may be used to
     using that you will have to specify differently for the TD
     assembler expression parser to accept them:

       a. Size overrides should always appear inside the
          brackets; PTR is optional after the size. Also, when
          referring to a structure, you must use the name of the
          struc, not the name of the variable:

          CORRECT:  [byte ptr bx]   [dword si]        [abc bx]

          INCORRECT: byte ptr[bx]    [struc abc bx]    [a bx]

       b. You must specify a structure name when accessing the
          members of a structure via a register pointer:

          CORRECT:  [abc ptr bx].mem1  [abc bx].mem3 + 1

          INCORRECT: [bx].mem1

       c. You can't use multiple instances of [] unless they are
          adjacent, and you can only follow an [] expression with
          a dot and a structure member name or another []
          expression:

          CORRECT:  4[bx][si]    [abc bx].mem2

          INCORRECT: [bx]4[si]    [bx]+4

       d. If you use a register as part of a memory expression
          and you don't specify a size, WORD is assumed:

            [bx] is the same as [word bx]

       e. You can use any register you want between [], not just
          the combinations of BX, BP, SI, and DI allowed in
          instruction operands:

          CORRECT:  [ax+bx]   [bx+sp]

       f. You can use multiple levels of [] to follow chains of
          pointers:

          CORRECT:  [byte [[nfmptr]+4]]

       g. Be careful using registers to access memory locations.
          You may get unexpected results if your segment
          registers are not set up properly. If you don't
          explicitly specify a segment register, Turbo Debugger
          uses the DS register to reference memory.

       h. When you do specify a segment register, make sure that
          you follow the same rule as for size overrides: put it
          INSIDE the brackets:

          CORRECT:  [byte es:di]    [es:fmptr]

          INCORRECT: es:[byte di]

       i. Use the OFFSET operator to get the address of a
          variable or structure. Turbo Debugger automatically
          supplies the [] around a variable name if you just type
          the variable name alone:

            a            contents of structure a
            [a]          contents of structure a
            offset a     address of structure a

       j. You can use the type overrides and the format control
          count to examine any area of memory displayed as you
          wish:

            [byte es:bx],10  10 bytes pointed to by es:bx
            [dword ds:si],4  4 dwords pointed to by ds:si

          This is very useful when specifying watch expressions.

       k. Sometimes you use a word memory location or register to
          point to a paragraph in memory that contains a data
          structure. Access the structure with expressions like:

            [abc [xx]:0].mem1
            [abc es:0].mem3

  Q. Are there any syntactic or parsing differences between Turbo
     Debugger's C expression evaluation and Turbo C's?

  A. You can't pass constant-string arguments when evaluating
     functions.

     CORRECT:  myfunc(123)   myfunc(string_variable)

     INCORRECT:  myfunc("constant")

  Q. Are there any syntactic or parsing differences between Turbo
     Debugger's Pascal expression evaluation and Turbo Pascal's?

  A. The differences are:

     a. Turbo Debugger does not support expressions for set
        constructors:

        CORRECT:   [4..7]

        INCORRECT: [myvar1..myvar2]   [3+4..7+8]

     b. You can't pass constant-string arguments when evaluating
        functions or procedures.

        CORRECT:   MyFunc(123)   MyFunc(StringVariable)

        INCORRECT: MyFunc('Constant')

                MyFunc(StringConstant), where StringConstant is
                defined with a "const" declaration and is not a
                typed constant.

     c. You can't evaluate procedures or functions that have
        structure VALUE parameters. You can evaluate procedures or
        functions that have structure VARIABLE parameters, though.

  Q. What should I be aware of when I am debugging multi-language
     programs with Turbo Debugger?

  A. Turbo Debugger's default source language is "Auto," meaning
     that it chooses the expression language based on the current
     source module. This can cause some confusion if your program
     has source modules written in different languages (like C
     and assembler). Since you are actually entering a language
     expression any time that Turbo Debugger prompts you for a
     value or an address, this can cause some unexpected results:

     a. Even if you are in a CPU window or a Dump window, you
        must still enter addresses in the source language,
        despite the fact that the window is displaying in hex.
        For example, to display the contents of memory address
        1234:5678, you must type one of the following
        expressions, depending on your current source language:

          C            0x1234:0x5678
          Pascal        $1234:$5678
          Assembler      1234:5678

     b. When your current language is assembler, you must be
        careful when entering hex numbers, since they are
        interpreted EXACTLY as they would be in an assembler
        source file. This means that if you want to enter a
        number that starts with one of the hex digits A - F, you
        must first precede the letter with a 0 so Turbo Debugger
        knows that you are entering a number. Likewise, if your
        number ends in B or D (indicating a binary or decimal
        number), you must add an H to indicate if you really want
        a hex number:

        CORRECT:    0aaaa   123dh   89abh

        INCORRECT:  aaaa    123d    89ab

  Q. Why does the text "Cannot be changed" come up when I do an
     assignment in the Data/Evaluate/Modify "New value" pane?

  A. If you use the Data/Evaluate/Modify command (Ctrl-F4) to
     change a variable by direct assignment, the "New value" pane
     will say "Cannot be changed." This does not mean that the
     assignment did not take effect. Instead it means that the
     assignment expression as a whole is not a memory-referencing
     expression whose value you can change by moving to the
     bottom pane. Here are some examples of direct assignment
     expressions:

       C              x = 4
       Pascal         ratio := 1.234
       Assembler      wval = 4 shl 2

     If you had typed just "x," "ratio," or "wval" into the top
     pane, then you would be able to move to the bottom pane and
     enter a new value. The direct assignment method using the
     "=" or ":=" assignment operator is quicker and more
     convenient if you don't care about examining the value of
     the variable before modifying it.

  Q. Why does an inspector occasionally display question marks
     when inspecting a Turbo C register variable?

  A. If you inspect a register variable that is not in the
     current scope, you'll see ???? for the value. A register
     variable only displays a value if the register is in your
     current scope (valid at the current location in your
     program).

  Q. What is the most likely reason for Turbo Debugger to hang
     when starting up on a PC-compatible computer?

  A. If your computer is a Tandy 1000A, IBM PC Convertible, or
     NEC MultiSpeed, or if TD hangs when loading on your system,
     run TDINST and change the last item in the Options menu so
     that NMI Intercept is set to "No." Some computers use the
     NMI (Non-Maskable Interrupt) in ways that conflict with TD,
     so you must disable TD's use of this interrupt in order to
     run the program.

     Also, if you are using a 80386-based machine and have the
     SuperKey utility loaded, be careful not to press a key when
     TD386 is loading, since SuperKey may capture the keystroke
     and cause unexpected results.

  Q. Why do I get the message "Cannot run TD386: processor is
     already in V8086 mode"?

  A. You have installed a program or device driver that uses the
     80386's virtual-8086 mode (eg. 386^MAX, CEMM, QEMM). You
     will have to disable or de-install those programs or device
     drivers to be able to run TD386.
