TURBO DEBUGGER 1.0: MANUAL ADDITIONS AND CORRECTIONS
----------------------------------------------------

The following documents changes to the manual that were made
after it went to print. Please read this file and make the
appropriate corrections in the Turbo Debugger User's Guide.

Page

8 End of page, add: "TD.OVL is the file containing the menu system
  and must be available to TD whenever you use the menus. If
  TD.OVL is not available when you load TD, an error message will
  inform you of such. In addition, if you're loading from a disk,
  the message will prompt you to insert the disk containing
  TD.OVL."

18 In the second and third bullets, delete "E" and add the
   letters B and D.

23 The third line in the third paragraph should read "...you have
   a choice of four commands: Create, Remove, Delete All, and
   Stop Recording".

30 Add to the last sentence of "Resizing and Saving Windows":
   "..from DOS if the configuration was saved to a file called
   TDCONFIG.TD. This is the only configuration file that will be
   loaded automatically when Turbo Debugger is loaded. Other
   configurations can be loaded (saved in other files) by using
   the Options/Restore Options selection in the main menu or
   using the-c command line option when loading TD." See the
   entry for page 52.

34,35 At the end of p34 and the first sentence of p35, change
      Alt-F R to Ctrl-F2.

35 Last sentence of the second paragraph under "Using Turbo
   Debugger" should read: "...File menu, in this case only the F1
   and Esc keys appear.

37 Replace the third paragraph with the following: There are a
   number of ways to control the execution of your program, a
   listing can be found in the Run menu. For instance, let's say
   you wanted to execute the program until it reaches line 38.
   First, position the cursor on line 38, then press F4, which
   will run the program up to (but not including) line 38. Now
   press F7, which executes one line of source code at a time; in
   this case, it executes line 38, a call to the function
   showargs. The cursor will immediately jump to line 150 where
   the definition of showargs is found. Continuing to press F7
   will step through the function showargs and then return you to
   the line following the call--line 39. If you pressed F8
   instead of F7 when positioned on line 38, the cursor would
   have gone directly to line 39 not to the function. F8 is
   similar to F7 except that it skips over any calls, but it
   still executes them.

37 Last line, first paragraph should read, "The arrow and cursor
   are on the next executable line."

39 Figure 3.4, change the contents of the Watches window to the following:

     nwords                   unsigned int   2  (0x2)

40 Last paragraph, 3rd line, modify to read: "An inspector
   appears showing the values of the letterinfo array elements."
   And add: "The first line under the title is the address in
   main memory of the first element of the array letterinfo."
   Note that this number will probably be different on your
   system.

41 In Figure 3.6, the title of the Inspector window should be
   "Inspecting letterinfo[3]."

   In the first line, modify it to read, "...name of the data you
   are inspecting. The next...".

   The Inspector window in Figure 3.6 should look like this:

         Inspecting letterinfo        3
         @5A51:08F4
         [0]                      (1,1)
         [1]                      (1,0)
         [2]                      (1,0)
         [3]                      (1,1)
         [4]                      (1,0)
         Inspecting letterinfo[3]     4
         @5A51:0904
         count                  1 (0x1)
         firstletter            0 (0x1)
         -----------------------------
         struct linfo

42 First paragraph after Figure 3.7, change the last line to
   "...the new value, 10L (0xA)."

   On the next paragraph, the last line: "Type argc and press
   Enter, then press the Tab key twice to move to the line
   labeled New Value. Type 123 and press Enter; the integer
   result (second line) will change to int 123 (0x7B).

48 Add to the second paragraph after Figure 3.13: "This will set
   the variable NumLines equal to 123."

51 In the first paragraph under "Running Turbo Debugger," add to
   the end: "TD.OVL must be available for TD to call upon for its
   menu system."

52 Under "Command-Line Options," add the -c<filename> option.
   This option loads the specified configuration file. If this
   option isn't specified, TDCONFIG.TD is loaded, if it exists.
   Here's an example:

      TD -cMYCONF.TD TCDEMO

   This loads the configuration file MYCONF.TD and the source
   code for TCDEMO. A space cannot exist between -c and the file
   name.

53 Under the -m option, a space cannot exist between the -m and
   the size of the heap; for example, TD -m64 TCDEMO.

54 Under the -r Options, the default speed is 115 Kbaud.

55 The bottom line should read, "...those default option values
   and any values in TDCONFIG.TD."

57 Under "Create," add to the end of the first paragraph: "To
   begin a recording session, enter F10/Option/Macro/Create. You
   will be prompted for the key you want to assign the macro to.
   The message "Recording" is displayed in the upper right-hand
   corner while the recording session is in progress.

59 To the "Save Options Command" add: "Turbo Debugger allows you
   to save your options in three ways:

   All    - Saves all settings made in options, including
              windows and macros
   Layout - Saves only the windowing layout
   Macros - Saves only the currently defined macros

73 Add to the end of "Animate [Alt-F4]": "After activating Alt-
   F4, you'll be prompted for a time delay between successive
   traces. The time delay is in 10ths of a second; the default is 3".

76 Add to "Keystroke Recording and Playback": Note: When a macro
   is saved to a configuration file, the configuration of the
   total environment is saved, including opened view windows and
   zoomed windows. Thus if you record a macro that opens a view
   window and don't close the window before saving it, the next
   time you do a Restore of that configuration file, the window
   will be automatically opened without executing the macro.

82 After "Watch," add a new section: "Function Return" shows you
   the value the current function is about to return. You can
   only use this command when the function is about to return to
   its caller.

   The return value is displayed in an Inspector window, so you
   can easily examine return values that are pointers to compound
   data objects.

   This command prevents you from having to switch to a CPU
   window to examine the return value that is placed in the CPU
   registers.

85 The second line under "Watch," change "end" to "beginning."

86 To the end of the third paragraph under "Inspector
   Windows," add "..., unless it has been optimized to a register".

110 The example at the end of the page should be "(long) a,4".

111 Replace "TDH.SYS" with "TDH386.SYS" in the fifth paragraph.

137 The second sentence in the last paragraph should read, "An
    expression consists of a mixture of symbols, operators,
    strings, variables, and constants."

158,159 Change all occurrences of "I/O location" to "I/O port."

171 At the top of page, replace lines 2-6 with the following:
    "When assembling an instruction or evaluating an assembler
    expression to refer to the contents of a variable, use the
    name of the variable alone or between brackets:

            mov ax,[a]
            mov dx,a

    To refer to the address of the variable, use the OFFSET
    operator:

            mov ax,offset a

178 Add the "Empty" local menu command: "Empty" sets the value of
    the currently highlighted register to empty. This is a
    special status that indicates that the register no longer
    contains valid data.

183 The Shift-arrow keys move between the panes in a window. The
    pane in the direction of the arrow becomes the active pane.

195 The description for the shifted arrow keys in the table on
    this page should be

    Key                Function
   -----------------------------------------------------------
    Shift-Up arrow     Resizes window - Moves bottom up
    Shift-Down arrow   Resizes window - Moves bottom down
    Shift-Left arrow   Resizes window - Moves right side left
    Shift-Right arrow  Resizes window - Moves right side right

199 The "Save Options..." menu command has three options that
    control which part of the configuration gets saved (see the
    entry for p59):

    All
    Macros
    Layout

226 In the last line of first paragraph under "Starting Turbo
    Debugger," change Alt-F L to Ctrl-F2.

227 In the fifth line of the third paragraph, replace "wordcount"
    with "charcount."

228 In the first line of the second paragraph under Eureka!,
    change Alt-F L to Ctrl-F2. Do the same for the third
    paragraph, fourth line.

238 Change "1024 bytes of DOS env" to "256 bytes of DOS env".

239 Change the discription of -w to say "You can enter a new
    executable file name that does not already exist and TD386
    will create the new executable file."

244 The -vb option no longer exists as a command-line option.

249 Add a section: "TDRF Remote File Transfer Utility"  You can
    enter a new executable file name that does not have to
    already exist. TDRF will create the new executable file.

250 In the first paragraph, add: "The wild cards * and ? can
    be used with the COPY, COPYFROM, DEL, and DIR commands that
    follow.

    Change the explanation for COPY to "Copies files from the
    local system to the remote system. You can..."

    The explanation for COPYFROM should read: "Copies files from
    the remote system to the local system. The single..." An
    additional example is

    TDRF F TC*.* A:\TCDEMO

    which copies all files beginning with TC on the current
    directory of the remote system to the local system's drive A,
    subdirectory TCDEMO.

251 At the bottom of the page, change FILE2 to TEST2.

255 Add: If you specify the -c option, the input .EXE file is
    converted into a .COM file. If you use -c in conjunction with
    -s, you can convert an .EXE file with symbols into a .COM
    file with a separate .TDS symbol file. This lets you debug
    .COM files with Turbo Debugger while retaining full debugging
    information.

    You can only convert certain .EXE files into .COM files. The
    same restrictions apply to the -c option of TDSTRIP as to the
    /t option of TLINK: Your program must start at location 100
    hex, and it can't contain any segment fixups.

275 Under "The User Screen Updating Option," add to the
    discussion under "Swap": "Also, use the Swap option if you
    Shell out to DOS and run other utilities or if you have a TSR
    (such as SideKick) loaded.

277 "43/50 line mode startup" is now called "Screen Lines." Also,
    line one of the explanation should read: "Press S to...."

279 Add to "Key for Interrupt": You choose the key for interrupt
    by directly pressing the key combination that you wish to
    use. You can use any combination of the Left-Shift, Right-
    Shift, Alt, and Ctrl keys, along with a normal keyboard
    character like a letter, function key, etc. For example,

         Shift-Alt-F1
         Left shift-Right shift-Spacebar

    On extended 101-key keyboards, Turbo Debugger does not
    distinguish between the left and right Alt keys or the left
    and right Ctrl keys. The left and right shift keys are still
    treated distinctly.

282 TDINST now has a separate Save and Quit command on the main
    menu. If you select Save, a menu appears that lets you choose
    between saving the configuration directly to the Turbo
    Debugger executable program file TD.EXE, or to a
    configuration file.

    If you choose to save to a configuration file, a prompt
    appears initialized to the default configuration file
    TDCONFIG.TD. You can accept this name by pressing Enter or
    you can type a new configuration file name. If you specify a
    different file name, you can load that configuration by using
    the -c command-line option when you start Turbo Debugger, for
    example,

          td -cmycfg myprog

    You can also use the Options/Restore Configuration command to
    load a configuration once you have started Turbo Debugger.

284 Bottom of page: You can use data watching with breakpoints
    that are not longer than 4 bytes

286 Middle of page: Change  "MOV AL,[1234]" to "MOV AX,[1234]".

301 Add: "You can enter a new executable file name that does not
    already exist. TDREMOTE will create the new executable file."
