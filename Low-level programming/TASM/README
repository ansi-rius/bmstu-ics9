2. INSTALLATION
---------------

This disk contains a program called INSTALL.EXE that will assist
you with the installation of Turbo Debugger 1.0. There are three
options for installation:

  1. Hard Disk - INSTALL will copy all Turbo Debugger files onto
     your hard disk and put them into subdirectories. The default
     subdirectories are

       Turbo Debugger Directory:                    C:\TD
       Example Subdirectory:                        C:\TD

     By default, all files from the distribution disks are placed
     in the Turbo Debugger Directory. If you would rather
     separate the examples programs into their own subdirectory
     as well, edit the default example files path before
     selecting START INSTALLATION.

  2. Floppy Disk - This option will build a working Turbo
     Debugger 4-disk set that will work on a two drive system. Be
     sure to have four formatted disks ready before you start.
     Install will build

       Program Disk - Turbo Debugger main program, Readme file,
       Turbo Debugger customization program, Helpme file and
       Manual file.

       Work Disk - Turbo Debugger working overlay file and help
       file.

       Utilities Disk - Turbo Debugger utilities.

       Examples Disk - Example programs for use with Turbo
       Debugger.

To start the installation, change your current drive to the one
that has the install program on it and type INSTALL. You will be
given instructions in a box at the bottom of the screen for each
prompt. For example, if you will be installing from drive A:, you
would type

  A:
  INSTALL

You should read the rest of this README file to get further
information about this release before you do the installation.

The Turbo Debugger UTILITIES/EXAMPLES distribution disk contains
several files with an .ARC file extension: TDEXAMPL.ARC,
TAEXAMPL1.ARC, and TAEXAMPL2.ARC. These files contain several
other files that have been compressed and placed inside an
archive. You can dearchive them yourself by using the UNPACK.COM
utility.

For example,

  unpack tdexampl

unpacks all the files stored in the TDEXAMPL.ARC archive into the
current directory.

INSTALL gives you a choice of copying the .ARC files intact or
dearchiving and copying all of the individual files onto your
hard disk during the installation process. Note that INSTALL does
not unpack the TAEXAMPL1.ARC, TAEXAMPL2.ARC, or CHAPXMPL.ARC files
from the UTILITIES/EXAMPLES disk. These files contain example
programs for the TURBO ASSEMBLER.

If you have difficulty reading the text displayed by the INSTALL
program, it accepts an optional command-line parameter that forces
it to use black and white colors:

  a:install /B      - Forces INSTALL into BW80 mode

Specifying the /B parameter may be necessary if you are using an
LCD screen or a system that has a color graphics adapter and a
monochrome or composite monitor.


3. IMPORTANT ADDITIONS
----------------------

  3.1 Changes to the command-line options for TD
  ----------------------------------------------

  -h   a list of all the command-line options available for TD.EXE

  -c   lets you specify a configuration file that will be loaded at
       startup. By default, Turbo Debugger uses the configuration
       file TDCONFIG.TD (if found); if you give the -c<file> option,
       Turbo Debugger will use that file instead.

       You must supply a configuration file name after the -c,
       with no space between the -c and the file name, for
       example,

         TD -cmyconfig myprog

       If you don't supply an extension to the file name, Turbo
       Debugger adds the .TD extension.

  -m   If you specify a heap size of 0 with the -m command-line
       option (-m0), Turbo Debugger will use the maximum that it's
       able to use, 64K. Specifying a value larger than 64K may
       cause unexpected results.

  -vp  Enable EGA palette save.

       This new command-line option controls palette swapping on
       EGA video adapters. It is only recommended when the user
       program modifies the EGA palette registers. When -vp is
       specified, the EGA palette is restored each time the
       screen is swapped. In general, you don't need to use this
       option unless your program modifies the EGA palette
       registers, or unless your program uses BGI to change the
       palette.


  3.2 Changes to the command-line options for TD utilities
  --------------------------------------------------------

  For a list of all the command-line options available for
  TDINST.EXE, TDREMOTE.EXE, INSTALL.EXE, and TDNMI.COM, enter
  the program name followed by -h:

    <program name> -h.

  For a list of all the command-line options available for
  TDMAP.EXE, TDPACK.EXE, TDRF.EXE, TDSTRIP.EXE, TDCONVRT.EXE,
  TD386.EXE and TDUMP.EXE, just type the program name:

    <program name>

  Note: If you have an 80386-based machine and want to read the
  command-line options for TD386.EXE, TDH386.SYS must be loaded.


  3.3  TD.OVL
  -----------

  Turbo Debugger consists of an executable program, TD.EXE, and
  an overlay file, TD.OVL. Both files are required.  On a hard
  disk system, they should be put in the same directory.

  If you are running on a two-floppy system, you should put the
  overlay file (TD.OVL) and the help file (TDHELP.TDH) on one
  diskette and TD.EXE on another diskette. To start Turbo
  Debugger, you insert the disk containing TD.EXE and type "TD"
  on the command line. You will then be prompted to insert the
  diskette containing the overlay file.

  Once you have inserted the overlay diskette, don't remove it
  for the remainder of your debugging session.


  3.4  TDNMI.COM UTILITY
  ----------------------

  If you are using a breakout switch on a PC clone that disables
  the NMI interrupt (such as some PC's Limited systems), you will
  need to install the TDNMI resident utility to clear the NMI every
  half second.

  Use TDNMI with the /p option if you have a Periscope I board
  and wish to use its breakout switch with Turbo Debugger. TDNMI
  will then periodically reset the breakout-switch latch on the
  Periscope board.  Use the /p command-line option followed by a
  hex address to set the board's base address if it is different
  from the default address of 300.


  3.5 Additions to hardware device driver interface
  -------------------------------------------------

  o The "Get Hardware Capabilities" status block returned by the
    device driver has an additional field that it returns after
    the "Maximum data match length field." This field is 2 bytes
    long and specifies the segment address where Turbo Debugger
    must write a byte with a value of 1 to enable hardware
    breakpoints. The field must contain 0 if the device driver
    does not or cannot support this capability. If supported,
    this byte allows Turbo Debugger to inform the device driver
    that it has finished writing things to the address space of
    the program being debugged, and that subsequent accesses can
    cause hardware breakpoints.

  o The special value FE (hex) can be returned by the hardware
    device driver if it has been recursively entered while
    processing a hardware breakpoint. This can happen if a
    hardware breakpoint has been set in the 6 bytes below the
    current top of stack in the program being debugged. If Turbo
    Debugger receives this entry code, it displays a message that
    the device driver can't proceed because of a breakpoint being
    set near the top of the stack.

  3.6 Extensions to the built-in assembler in the CPU window
  ----------------------------------------------------------

  Turbo Debugger supports all 80386 and 80387 instructions
  mnemonics and registers:

    80386 Registers:

      EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, ESI, EDI, EBP, ESP

    80386 Op Codes:

      BSF, BSR, BT, BTC, BTR, BTS, CDQ, CWDE, IRETD, LFS, LGS,
      LSS, MOVSX, MOVZX, POPAD, POPFD, PUSHAD, PUSHFD, SETA,
      SETB, SETBE, SETE, SETG, SETL, SETLE, SETNB, SETNE,
      SETNL, SETNO, SETNP, SETNS SETO, SETP, SETS, SHLD, SHRD,
      CMPSD, STOSD, LODSD, MOVSD, SCASD, INSD OUTSD, JECXZ

    80387 Op Codes:

      FCOS, FSIN, FPREM1, FSINCOS, FUCOM, FUCOMP, FUCOMPP


4. NOTES AND RESTRICTIONS
-------------------------

o You need to set the files directive in your CONFIG.SYS file to
  at least FILES = 10, preferably FILES = 20. If you have trouble
  doing the File/OS Shell command or if TD can't find your source
  modules, make sure the FILES directive is in your CONFIG.SYS.

o FNxxxx variants of floating-point instructions are not
  supported in the built-in assembler in the CPU window.

  The Fxxxx instructions do not generate an FWAIT in Turbo
  Debugger. You must manually code an FWAIT before floating-point
  instructions if needed.

o A single Ctrl-Break when inside a DOS function call waiting for
  console input will not interrupt DOS and return control to
  Turbo Debugger. You can either press Ctrl-Break once and then
  end the console input function by pressing Enter, or you can
  press Ctrl-Break a second time.  You will then interrupt DOS and
  Turbo Debugger will bring up a CPU Viewer showing code inside
  DOS.  At this point, you can look around inside your program,
  but you may not be able to use F7 or F8 to trace or step inside
  DOS.  You should only use F9 at this point, after possibly
  setting a breakpoint inside your program.

o TD386 uses INT FF to communicate with its protected-mode
  supervisor. Therefore, you can't debug programs with TD386 that
  use INT FF. If your program uses INT FF, change to using a
  different interrupt (e.g., INT FE) while you are debugging your
  program under TD386.

Additions and corrections to the Turbo Debugger User's Guide that
were made after it went to print are listed in MANUAL.DOC on the
Turbo Debugger Help/Utilities Disk. We recommend that you read
MANUAL.DOC and make the appropriate corrections in the Turbo
Debugger User's Guide. You may use the README.COM utility supplied
